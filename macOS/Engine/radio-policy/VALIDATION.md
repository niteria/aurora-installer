# Candidate source validation

Validation on x86_64 NixOS, 2026-10-14. Implementation commit: `f6c9b9395e3a8a327ede4c07471c7d500a2d3de9`, based on Aurora native installer `d9981171da408ad0451c768588fdc888646f95af`. A follow-up adds this record, a simulated-macOS package-origin test and source-test portability/documentation corrections; it does not change the runtime or packaging implementation.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Focused radio candidate tests, Python3.14.7 + Unicorn2.1.4 | 23 passed after the follow-up, including actual private-stock parity, simulated macOS import refusal and emulator fail-closed cases. |
| Existing engine/source-lock tests | 41 passed; the original source lock and released inputs are unchanged. |
| Existing overlay suite | 307 run, 22 existing environment-dependent skips, no failures. |
| Existing script Python suite | 44 passed. |
| Image producer source suite | Passed: 25 candidate-set, 47 inspection, 26 image-check and 11 lab-access tests, plus shell fixtures. |
| Full `macOS/test/all` | Python/syntax and preceding packaging fixtures pass, then the unchanged preview identity check fails: `the app signing identity belongs to the configured team`. The unsigned Aurora preview has no configured Developer ID identity. |
| Real macOS-arm64 Unicorn wheel | Downloaded bytes independently match the pinned size/SHA-256; safe 40-file inventory and restricted-loader Python syntax verified. Native dylib was not executed on Linux. |
| Private original inputs | Ported child process generated 10,241 bytes with SHA-256 `926b390f709a4125a53ecbc12d5b94eba765f142e099b9a711b43dda23f7aea0`, matching the previously qualified output. No private input/output blobs are part of the commit. |

The portable commands are in README.md. On this NixOS host, the inherited suites also needed GnuPG/libarchive/jq on PATH, `LC_ALL=C`, and an unprivileged Bubblewrap view supplying `/bin/bash` and `/usr/bin/perl` plus private writable `/tmp`; neither source checks nor host installation files were changed to accommodate those assumptions. Initial runs exposed the missing tools/absolute paths and locale-dependent formatting; the image suite subsequently passed, and the installer aggregate reached the documented identity failure above.

Synthetic candidate-archive tests verify real collector patch application and preservation of base payload bytes, native-loader failure without host fallback, candidate version and per-file receipts. A real `.39`-based candidate archive, macOS bundled/signed-runtime JIT execution, Swift application packaging and fresh hardware installation have not been qualified. Access to the exact pinned `.39` artifact is needed for that next step. This PR is a source candidate, not a release promotion or a Neo deployment.
